Introduction
This project aims to create an intelligent system that can read and understand documents and images, and provide relevant answers to user prompts. By combining RAG, LangChain, and OCR technologies, the system achieves high accuracy and efficiency in processing textual and visual data.

Features
RAG Integration: Uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation to enhance the accuracy of responses.
LangChain Library: Utilizes LangChain for seamless data processing and chaining operations.
OCR Capability: Reads text from images and documents using OCR technology.
Ollama Model: Implements the Ollama embedding model for high-quality text comprehension and response generation.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Nitin-khedkar369/Personalized-AI.git
cd Personalized-AI
Create and activate a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Load your documents or images into the data directory.
Run the main script to process the files:
bash
Copy code
python main.py
Provide prompts to get answers based on the content of the documents/images.
Example
python
Copy code
from langchain_community import PyPDFLoader
from some_ocr_module import OCRReader
from ollama import OllamaModel
from rag_pipeline import RAGPipeline

# Initialize components
pdf_loader = PyPDFLoader()
ocr_reader = OCRReader()
ollama_model = OllamaModel()
rag_pipeline = RAGPipeline(ollama_model)

# Load document
document = pdf_loader.load("data/sample.pdf")

# Read text from image
image_text = ocr_reader.read("data/sample_image.png")

# Process and get answers
answer = rag_pipeline.process(document, "What is the main topic of this document?")
print(answer)
